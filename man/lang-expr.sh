#Print the value of EXPRESSION to standard output.  A blank line below
#separates increasing precedence groups.  EXPRESSION may be:

  ARG1 | ARG2       ARG1 if it is neither null nor 0, otherwise ARG2

  ARG1 & ARG2       ARG1 if neither argument is null or 0, otherwise 0

  ARG1 < ARG2       ARG1 is less than ARG2
  ARG1 <= ARG2      ARG1 is less than or equal to ARG2
  ARG1 = ARG2       ARG1 is equal to ARG2
  ARG1 != ARG2      ARG1 is unequal to ARG2
  ARG1 >= ARG2      ARG1 is greater than or equal to ARG2
  ARG1 > ARG2       ARG1 is greater than ARG2

  ARG1 + ARG2       arithmetic sum of ARG1 and ARG2
  ARG1 - ARG2       arithmetic difference of ARG1 and ARG2

  ARG1 * ARG2       arithmetic product of ARG1 and ARG2
  ARG1 / ARG2       arithmetic quotient of ARG1 divided by ARG2
  ARG1 % ARG2       arithmetic remainder of ARG1 divided by ARG2

  STRING : REGEXP   anchored pattern match of REGEXP in STRING

  match STRING REGEXP        same as STRING : REGEXP
  substr STRING POS LENGTH   substring of STRING, POS counted from 1
  index STRING CHARS         index in STRING where any CHARS is found, or 0
  length STRING              length of STRING
  + TOKEN                    interpret TOKEN as a string, even if it is a
                               keyword like 'match' or an operator like '/'
